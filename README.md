# -Doc-Management-Secure-File-Transfer-System
Built a secure web application for encrypted document sharing and user-based file access using Python, Django, and Razorpay integration. The system includes user registration, login, and session-based authentication. Files can be uploaded as public, private, or user-privileged documents, with optional password protection using Djangoâ€™s password hashing. It features cloud file storage, subscription-based access using custom packages, and real-time Razorpay payment gateway integration.

Included features like:

    Upload/download of documents with storage limits and expiry based on user package.

    Document sharing with access control and revocation via custom models.

    Password-protected private files.

    Recycle bin management for deleted files.

    Feedback and contact form handling.

    Payment tracking and validation using Razorpay.

    Cloud document upload and listing.

    Admin and user privilege logic with Django models.
